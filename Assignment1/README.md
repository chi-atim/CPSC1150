### Assignment #1

Goals:  
This assignment gives students more experience in:  
•	Problem Solving  
•	Writing Java programs 

Problem Description:  
Write a Java program that calculates the value of a stock sale. The user will be prompted to enter the stock price, the number of shares to be sold, and the commission rate. 
The program will calculate the value of the shares by multiplying the stock price by the number of shares. It will also calculate the commission (the value of the shares multiplied by the commission rate) and the net proceeds (the value of the shares minus the commission).
The following example shows what the user will see on the screen:

	This program calculates the net proceeds from a sale of stock.

	Enter stock price: $10.12
	Enter number of shares: 11
	Enter commission rate (as a percentage): 5.5
-----------------------
	Value of share: $111.32
	Commission: $6.1226
	Net proceeds: $105.1974

Notes:  
•	In the above example, user should provide the information shown in italic.  
   Your program should calculate and display the rest.  
•	Your calculation may result in more than two digits after the decimal point, it is fine to show it that way.  
•	Test your program with different inputs.  
•	Submit your source code (.java file) to BrightSpace.
