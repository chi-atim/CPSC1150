•	Use the Scanner nextLine method to read the sentence from the user.  
•	Create a method for each task.  
•	In your main method read the sentence from the user, then display the menu, and use a switch statement to call appropriate method for each task.  
•	The program should be repeated until the user enters 6 to terminate.  
  

Key points:  
•	Presentation/Style: Organization, readability, descriptive identifier, indentation, bracket placement.  
•	Correctness: Program works without bugs.
