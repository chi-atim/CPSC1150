### Assignment #7


Goals:  
This lab gives students more experience in  
•	Top-down Design and procedural abstraction.  
•	Good style programming.  
    
    
    
Background Information:  
Roman Numbers. The Roman Number System has seven digits as follows:  

    I	1
    V	5
    X	10	
    L	50
    C	100
    D	500
    M	1000
    
    
Numbers are formed according to the following rules:  
1.	Only numbers up to 3999 are represented.  
2.	As in decimal system, the thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones are expressed separately.  
3.  The numbers 1 to 9 are expressed as shown.  As you can see, an I preceding a V or X is subtracted from the value, and you can never have more than three I’s in a row.  
**I	  II	  III	  IV	  V	  VI	  VII 	VIII	  IX**
4.	Tens and hundreds are done the same way, except that letters X, L, C, D, M are used instead of letters **I, V, X**.  
    
    
    
Requirement:  
Write an algorithm and then a structured program that converts a positive integer into Roman Number System.
The program shall take, as input, a number such as 1978, and convert it to its equivalent in the Roman Number System as MCMLXXVIII.

    
Key points:  
• Presentation/Style: Organization, readability, descriptive identifier, indentation, bracket placement.  
• Correctness: Program works without bugs. Appropriate us of methods.  
• Documentation: Internal
