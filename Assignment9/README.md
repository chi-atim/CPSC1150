### Assignment #9

Goals:  
This lab gives students more experience in  
•	Top-down design.  
•	Procedural abstraction using methods.  
•	Good style programming.  
  
  

Requirement:  
Write a structured program that can accept two integer numbers up to 40 digits and perform the followings:  
1.	Add the two numbers and display the result.  
2.	The result number should be separated by commas.   
For example  

        If inputs are:
        Number1:   236598745632
        Number2:   2453254365546764765

        The output should be:
                  236,598,745,632 +
        2,453,254,365,546,764,765
        ---------------------------
        2,453,254,602,145,510,397
	

Notes:  
•	You must read the two input numbers as string objects, then verify if the input is correct (i.e. all digit characters).  
•	You may assume that your program only works for positive integer numbers.   
•	You cannot use any of BigDecimal / BigInteger / double / long / int types for your calculations.  



Key points:  
•	Presentation/Style: Organization, readability, descriptive  identifier, indentation, bracket placement.  
•	Program works without bugs. Appropriate use of methods.  
•	Internal Documentation and External document (Provide pseudo code for the method which adds the two String umbers)
