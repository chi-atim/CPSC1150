### Lab 1

Write a program that reads in the radius and length of a cylinder and computes the area and volume using the following formula:  
	area = radius * radius * Ï€ 
	volume = area * length  

Here is a sample run:  

	Enter the radius of a cylinder: 5.5 
	Enter the length of a cylinder: 12  

	The volume is 1140.4
